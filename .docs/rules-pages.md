ðŸ‘‰ Configuration
The .pages.yml file
Media

To configure Pages CMS you just need to add a .pages.yml file to the repository (and branch) that hosts your content and media. If this file isn't there when you open your repository/branch in Pages CMS, you will be presented with a link to add one via the Pages CMS interface.

You can have different configuration files on separate branches. The Pages CMS interface allows you to navigate between them (click on the name of repository at the top of the sidebar and then select the branch in the dropdown menu).

The .pages.yml file contains mainly 2 sections:

media: the settings for media (images, videos, etc). See the "Media" section below.
content: an array defining the content types. See the "Content" section below.


Media
With media, you can configure how to handle files you want to upload, attach to or embed in your content. media can be a string, a single object or an array of objects depending on whether you want a single or multiple media folders and configurations.

Media

Keys
Key	Type	Description
name	string	Required if media is an array. Must be unique across the media array. Machine name for the media entry.
label	string	Display name for the media. This will be displayed in the main menu.
input	string	The path to the media folder relative to the root of the repo (e.g. src/files/media). This path is what allows us to find the files in Pages CMS to manage content and media.
output	string	The path to the media folder relative to the root of the website (e.g. files/media). This path will prefix all media saved in our content, which will be used by your static site generator.
path	string	The default path to present the user (e.g. when opening the media browser on an Image Field).
extensions	string	An array of file extensions that should be displayed. If provided, any file with an extension not included in this list will not be shown to the user.
categories	string	Similar to media.extensions, but using categories of files: image (jpg, jpeg, png, gif, svg, bmp, tif, tiff), document (pdf, doc, docx, ppt, pptx, vxls, xlsx, txt, rtf), video (mp4, avi, mov, wmv, flv), audio (mp3, wav, aac, ogg, flac) and compressed (zip, rar, 7z, tar, gz, tgz). If both media.extensions and media.categories are provided, media.categories will be ignored.
If media is set to a string, it is equivalent to settings both media.input and media.output to that value, prefixed with / for media.output.

For example, media: files/media would be equivalent to:

media:
  input: files/media
  output: /files/media
If we want to define multiple media configurations, we can use an array (see examples below).

Examples
Let's assume the content for my website is at the root of my repo:

media: files/media
Now, if the content for this website was in a src/ subfolder, it could look like this:

media:
  input: src/media
  output: media
Let's assume now that I'm hosting my website in a subfolder (e.g. hosted at http://example.com/my-website/), I may want to do the following:

media:
  input: src/media
  output: /my-website/media
Now, if I want to use a files/documents folder only for document uploads (e.g. pdf, doc, ppt) and another images folder with my photos that must be in .png or .webp formats, we could do the following:

media:
  - name: files
    label: Files
    input: files/documents
    output: /files/documents
    categories: [ document ]
  - label: images
    label: Images
    input: images
    output: /images
    extensions: [ png, webp ]
Content
Content managed by the users: collections (e.g. blog posts) and file types (e.g. the home page). The content key should be set as an array of content entries.

Collection view

Keys
Each content entry can define the following keys:

Key	Type	Description
name	string	Required and must be unique across the content array. Machine name for the content entry.
label	string	Display name for the collection or single file. This will be displayed in the main menu.
type	string	Required. collection or file, depending on whether the content entry is a collection of files with an identical schema (e.g. blog posts) or a single file (e.g. home page).
path	string	Required. Path to the folder where the files are stored if it's a collection (e.g. path: src/posts, otherwise the path to the single file (e.g. path: src/index.md).
fields	string	The list of fields defining the schema of the content entry (e.g. title, date, author, body, etc). See the "Fields" section below.
filename	string	The pattern to generate the filename when creating a new file. You can use the value of any field (e.g. fields.title) including nested values (e.g. fields.tags[0].label). You can also use a few date tokens ({year}, {month}, {day}) and time ({hour}, {minute}, {second}) and {primary} for the primary field as defined in the view key. By default this is set to '{year}-{month}-{day}-{primary}.md'.
exclude	array	An array of files to exclude from the collection (e.g. [ README.md ]). This is only valid for collections.
view	object	Only valid for collections. This object defines the various options for the collection view; visible fields, sorting options and defaults, fields indexed for the search... See the "View" section below.
format	string	The format of the file, used to set up the editor to edit the content: yaml-frontmatter, json-frontmatter, toml-frontmatter, yaml, json, toml, datagrid, code or raw. It defaults to yaml-frontmatter.
subfolders	boolean	Whether or not the collection should display subfolders. Default to true. Set to false if you want to force the collection of files to be "flat".
Examples
Let's assume we have a simple collection of blog posts all saved in the src/_posts folder:

content:
  - name: posts
    label: Posts
    path: src/_posts
    type: collection
    fields:
      (...)
  - name: authors
    label: Authors
    path: src/_data/authors.json
    type: file
    fields:
      (...)
View
The view object is only valid for type: collection content entries. It defines the configuration for the collection view, aka the page that lists the entries for a collection which is accessed from the main menu under a specific repo/branch (e.g. https://app.pagescms.org/pages-cms/template-nextjs/content/posts/).

Keys
Key	Type	Description
fields	array	List of the fields to be displayed in the collection view (e.g. fields: [ title, published, author ]). This can include nested fields and values (e.g. fields: [ title, published, "tags[0]", author.name ]). If not defined, it defaults to just the primary field (see below). The order of the fields is kept in the collection view.
primary	string	The name of the field that should be used as the primary field (e.g. primary: title). If undefined, it will be set to the title field if it exists, otherwise the first field define in the content entry (e.g. content.posts.fields[0].name).
sort	array	The list of fields that the collection can be sorted by (e.g. sort: [ date, title ]). By default, it is set to the date (if any) and the primary field.
search	array	The list of fields that should be indexed for search. By default, all fields are indexed.
default	object	Define the default values for search and sorting: { search: 'My keywords', sort: title, order: asc }). default.order can be asc or desc. By default, default.search is empty, default.sort is the first field in the sort array and default.order is set to desc.
Examples
Assuming you have a date field and title is the primary field, your default configuration would look like:

view:
  fields: [ title ]
  primary: title
  sort: [ date, title ]
  default:
    search: ''
    sort: title
    order: desc
This would display the title of each post and sort them by title in descendant order (start with special characters and numbers, all the way to z).

Let's assume we also have the following:

published, a boolean that defines whether or not the post is published,
author, a string set to the name of the author.
Let's set the view to only display the posts from Patricia, display title, date and the published state with the newer posts first:

view:
  fields: [ title, date, published ] # title is the first entry and thus will be set to primary
  sort: [ date, title, published ]
  default:
    search: 'author:Patricia'
    sort: date
    sort: desc
The author:Patricia syntax comes from lunr.js, the search library used by Pages CMS under the hood. Other syntax will work too (wildcards, boosts, fuzzy matches and term presence).

Fields
Keys
Key	Type	Description
name	string	Required and must be unique across the fields array. Machine name for the field. body is reserved for the body of the file when dealing with a frontmatter file (e.g. YAML frontmatter).
label	string	Display name for the field. This is what is displayed in the edit form.
description	string	Default value.
type	string	Defines the type of field: boolean, code, date, image, number, object, rich-text, select, string or text. If undefined or set to a field that doesn't exist, it defaults to text.
default		Default value.
list	boolean or object	If truthy, the field is an array of values (of the type defined for the field). See the "View" section below.
hidden	boolean	If true, the field will not be displayed in the form but will be saved. It is usually used with default to set a required field that shouldn't be edited by users, like for example the language of a post (lang: en-US).
required	boolean	If true, the field can't be empty.
pattern	string or object	A regular expression to validate the field. A custom message for the error can be provided by defining an object with regex and message attributes (e.g. pattern: { regex: 'This must be a valid email address (e.g. hello@example.com).', message: '^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$' })
fields	array	Only valid for object fields. List of the fields in that object.
options	object	Options for that field. Refer to the field specific details below.
List
Any field with a truthy list key will be stored as an array of that field type. For example:

name: images
label: Images
type: image
list: true
Will allow the user to save multiple image paths:

images:
  - media/image-1.png
  - media/image-2.png
list can be an object with min, max and default keys. min and max define the minimum and maximum number of entries in the array. For example:

name: images
label: Images
type: image
list:
  min: 1
  max: 4
This will force the user to enter at least 1 image and at most 4.

Certain fields (e.g. the [image field(/docs/configuration/image-field)]) implement their own list logic. If you want to use the default list widget, you may set default to true.

ðŸ‘‰ Boolean field
A simple toggle switch for true or false.

Options
No options.

Example
- name: published
  label: Published
  type: boolean
  default: true

ðŸ‘Œ Code field

ðŸ‘Œ Date field
Either a date or a date and time field, similar to the date and datetime inputs.

Options
Option	Type	Description
format	string	The date (or datetime) format (e.g. dd/MM/yyyy). This should be a valid date-fns format string. Default to yyyy-MM-dd, or yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm if time is true (see below).
time	string	If true, the field will allow the user to pick a date and a time using a <datetime> field. Default is false.
min	string	The earliest date to accept. If undefined, there is no min date. This must be formatted as a standard min value for a date input (i.e. yyyy-mm-dd) or min value for a datetime input (i.e. YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm).
min	string	The latest date to accept. If undefined, there is no max date. This must be formatted as a standard max value for a date input (i.e. yyyy-mm-dd) or max value for a datetime input (i.e. YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm).
step	string	Defines the granularity of values: number of days, or number of seconds if time is set to true. Behavior is the same as step for date and datetime inputs.
Examples
A simple example for a date that must be be December 24, 2023 or after:

- name: created
  label: Creation date
  type: date
  options:
    format: dd-MM-yyyy

        category: "electronics"
      results: data.products
      value: ""
      label: " ()"
      image: thumbnail

These changes make the documentation more accurate and provide clearer examples that match how your component actually works. The biggest difference is replacing `fetch.query` with `fetch.params` and showing how to use template strings in the API configuration.

ðŸ‘Œ Custom fields
Fields define how content gets displayed and edited. Pages CMS comes with a few built-in fields, but you can also add your own custom fields.

The fields folder
All fields are saved in the src/fields folder:

fields/
â”œâ”€ core/
â”‚  â”œâ”€ boolean/
â”‚  â”œâ”€ code/
â”‚  â”œâ”€ date/
â”‚  â”œâ”€ image/
â”‚  â”œâ”€ number/
â”‚  â”œâ”€ ...
â”œâ”€ custom/
â”‚  â”œâ”€ README.md
â”œâ”€ registry.js
core/ is where all the built-in fields are saved (e.g. boolean, code, date). The names of the fields subfolders match the types used in the configuration file (e.g. type: boolean).

custom/ (empty by default) is used to host the subfolders for custom fields.

registry.js is a helper function to create registries for the fields.

Individual fields
Each field folder (e.g. fields/core/boolean) should include an index.ts or index.tsx file that can export:

schema: a Zod schema used to process the field when saving. This is used for validation and format coertion.
supportsList: a boolean defining whether or not the field handles lists internally rather than using the default list behavior. Check fields/core/image for an example.
read: a function used to convert the field value when reading from a file (e.g. fields/core/date will convert from the format defined for that date field to a standard ISO 8601 date/datetime).
write: a function used to convert the field value when writing to a file (e.g. fields/core/date will convert from a standard ISO 8601 date/datetime to the format defined for that date field).
EditComponent: a React component used to edit the field.
ViewComponent: a React component used to display the field in a collection.
defaultValue: defines the default value for the field.
Example: fields/core/boolean
Let's have a look at the fields/core/boolean folder, which defines boolean fields:

fields/
â”œâ”€ core/
â”‚  â”œâ”€ boolean/
â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ edit-component.tsx
â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ index.tsx
â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ view-component.tsx
Edit component
edit-component.tsx is the React component used in the editor (for both creating or editing content). It is called by components/entry/entry-form.tsx via the editComponents registry.

In the case of the boolean field, it is a simple toggle switch:

"use client";

import { forwardRef } from "react";
import { Switch } from "@/components/ui/switch";

const EditComponent = forwardRef((props: any, ref: React.Ref<HTMLInputElement>) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Switch
        {...props}
        ref={ref}
        checked={props.value}
        onCheckedChange={props.onChange}
      />
    </div>
  );
});

export { EditComponent };
View component
view-component.tsx is the React component used to display the field value in collections. It is called by components/collection/collection-view.tsx via the viewComponents registry.

For boolean fields, we displayed a colored chip with the labels "True" or "False" if the value is defined, or nothing otherwise (undefined or null):

"use client";

const ViewComponent = ({ value }: { value: boolean}) => {
  return (
    <>
      {value == null
        ? null
        : value
          ? <span className="inline-block rounded-md bg-primary text-primary-foreground px-2 py-0.5 text-xs font-medium">True</span>
          : <span className="inline-block rounded-md border bg-muted px-2 py-0.5 text-xs font-medium">False</span>
      }
    </>
  );
};

export { ViewComponent };
Field registration
index.tsx registers the field. It is required for your field to work.

For the boolean field, this means exporting the edit/view components, the default value and the schema:

import { z } from "zod";
import { Field } from "@/types/field";
import { EditComponent } from "./edit-component";
import { ViewComponent } from "./view-component";

const defaultValue = false;

const schema = (field: Field) => {
  let zodSchema = z.coerce.boolean();

  return zodSchema;
};

export { EditComponent, ViewComponent, defaultValue, schema };
Notice that we define a default value (false) and coerce the field to a boolean in the schema function. This will ensure we're saving a boolean in the file, and not a string.

In some cases (e.g. the image field), we may also indicate support for lists with supportsList, and define read and write functions to convert the input and output values (when reading from or writing to the file).
